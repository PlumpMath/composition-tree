* Composition Trees

A /compositions list/ or /composition tree/ is a list data type where 
the elements are monoids, and the ~mconcat~ of any contiguous sublist 
can be computed in logarithmic time. A common use case of this type 
is in a wiki, version control system, or collaborative editor, where
each change or delta would be stored in a list, and it is sometimes
necessary to compute the composed delta between any two versions.

This version of a composition list is strictly biased to 
right-associativity, in that we only support efficient consing
to the front of the list.

This library is extensively covered by a comprehensive suite of
QuickCheck properties, which are written into the documentation and
run with ~doctest~.

The actual package only depends on ~base~, and is more or less
straightforward Haskell code.

It is released under the BSD3 license.
